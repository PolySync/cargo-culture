# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to check out `cargo-culture`,
Rust's project-level best practices linting tool!

## Principles

* The default rules are highly subjective, prepare to accept differences of opinion.
* Make a pull request or open a GitHub issue and the maintainers will give reviewing an honest shot.
* Forking is okay, building atop a shared core is better.

## Ways to Contribute

* Improve the robustness of the `cargo_culture_kit` library's generic checking infrastructure.
* Build your own crates that contain `Rule` implementations for more specific use cases.
* Make a good case for expanding or changing the default rules as a Github issue.
* The docs can always get better, you can make the unclear clear and the important explicit.
* Share your experiences with using the project, especially the areas for improvement using Github issues..
